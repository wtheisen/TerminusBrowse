## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Previously known as commandChan.

Created out of a desire to browse 4chan at work, TerminusBrowser is turning into a general framework for browsing
sites in the terminal using a single program.
This is currently a terminal browsing application for [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [lainchan](https://www.lainchan.org/).
Built using the [urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/) library for python.
It also makes use of the [4chan API](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API), the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/), a third-party [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api), and the [lainchan API](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan-API/). Development for all sites are still on-going so while basic browsing will work there may be smaller bugs or features than you may notice. Please feel free to notify the dev team by opening an issue, or PRs are always welcome!

To run, first install the dependencies in requirements.txt

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And then run `./TerminusBrowser.py`
