## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Created out of a desire to browse 4chan at work, commandChan is turning into a general framework for browsing
sites in the terminal using a unified program.
This is currently a terminal browsing application for [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/), and now [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
Built using the [urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/) library for python. 
It also makes use of the [4chan API](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API) and the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) 

To run, first install the dependencies in requirements.txt

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And then run `./commandChanVim.py`
